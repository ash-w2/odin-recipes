    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Don't call the local takeaway – impress friends and family by cooking this fragrant and creamy Thai green chicken curry. It's easy and quick to make</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>225g new potatoes, cut into chunks</li>
        <li>100g green beans, trimmed and halved</li>
        <li>1 tbsp vegetable or sunflower oil</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove, chopped</li>
        <li>1 rounded tbsp or 4 tsp Thai green curry paste (you can't fit the tablespoon into some of the jars)</li>
        <li>400ml can coconut milk</li>
        <li>2 tsp Thai fish sauce</li>
        <li>1 tsp caster sugar</li>
        <li>450g boneless skinless chicken (breasts or thighs), cut into bite-size pieces</li>
        <li>2 lime leaves finely shredded, or 3 wide strips lime zest, plus extra to garnish</li>
        <li>good handful of basil leaves</li>
        <li>boiled rice, to serve</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Put 225g new potatoes, cut into chunks, in a pan of boiling water and cook for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add 100g trimmed and halved green beans and cook for a further 3 minutes, by which time both should be just tender but not too soft. Drain and put to one side.</li>
        <li>In a wok or large frying pan, heat 1 tbsp vegetable or sunflower oil until very hot, then drop in 1 chopped garlic clove and cook until golden, this should take only a few seconds. Don’t let it go very dark or it will spoil the taste.</li>
        <li>Spoon in 1 rounded tbsp Thai green curry paste and stir it around for a few seconds to begin to cook the spices and release all the flavours.</li>
        <li>Next, pour in a 400ml can of coconut milk and let it come to a bubble.</li>
        <li>Stir in 2 tsp Thai fish sauce and 1 tsp caster sugar, then 450g bite-size chicken pieces. Turn the heat down to a simmer and cook, covered, for about 8 minutes until the chicken is cooked.</li>
        <li>Tip in the potatoes and beans and let them warm through in the hot coconut milk, then add 2 finely shredded lime leaves (or 3 wide strips lime zest).</li>
        <li>Add a good handful basil leaves, but only leave them briefly on the heat or they will quickly lose their brightness.</li>
        <li>Scatter with lime to garnish and serve immediately with boiled rice.</li>
    </ol>
